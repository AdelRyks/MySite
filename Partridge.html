      <h1>Partridge</h1>
      <p>A partridge is a medium-sized galliform bird in any of several genera, with a wide native distribution throughout parts of Europe, Asia and Africa. Several species have been introduced to the Americas. They are sometimes grouped in the Perdicinae subfamily of the Phasianidae (pheasants, quail, etc.). However, molecular research suggests that partridges are not a distinct taxon within the family Phasianidae, but that some species are closer to the pheasants, while others are closer to the junglefowl.</p>

      <h1>Description</h1>
      <p>Partridges are medium-sized game birds, generally intermediate in size between the larger pheasants, smaller quail; they're ground-dwelling birds that feature variable plumage colouration across species, with most tending to grey and brown.</p>

      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <p>The so-called "Vučedol dove", one of the most well-known emblems of the prehistorical Vučedol culture, is now interpreted as representing a male partridge as a symbol of fertility</p>
